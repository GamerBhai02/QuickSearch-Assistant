# Search Assistant: Multi-Platform Search Tool using Python and Tkinter

## Overview
**Search Assistant** is a Python-based GUI application built using Tkinter that allows users to search multiple platforms such as **YouTube**, **Google**, **Instagram**, **Twitter**, **Facebook**, and **LinkedIn**. This simple yet powerful tool helps users easily search for content across various platforms directly from a single application. 

With **Search Assistant**, you no longer need to open multiple browser tabs or applications to find what you're looking for on different platforms. Just select a platform, enter your query, and the app will take you directly to the search results in your browser.

## Features
- **YouTube Search**: Search for videos on YouTube.
- **Google Search**: Perform a web search directly on Google.
- **Instagram Profile Search**: Search Instagram profiles by username.
- **Twitter Profile Search**: Search Twitter profiles by username.
- **Facebook Page Search**: Search Facebook pages by username or page name.
- **LinkedIn Profile Search**: Search LinkedIn profiles by username.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The programming language used to create the app.
- **Tkinter**: Python's standard library for building the GUI (Graphical User Interface).
- **Webbrowser**: Python module to open web pages in the browser.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure that **Python 3** is installed on your machine. You can download Python from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Steps to Run the App:
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python search_assistant.py
   ```
Once the script is running, the GUI will open, and you can begin using the search assistant by selecting a platform and entering your search query.

## How It Works
1. **Platform Selection**: The user selects the desired platform (e.g., YouTube, Google, Instagram).
2. **Dynamic Instructions**: Upon selecting a platform, the app displays instructions on what to enter in the search box (such as a username or search query).
3. **Search Execution**: After entering the search query, the app will open the relevant platform's search results directly in your browser.
